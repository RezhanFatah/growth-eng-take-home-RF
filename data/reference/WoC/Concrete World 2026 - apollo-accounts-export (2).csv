These leading brands are sold through two distinct sales channels, the distributor-based Cast-In-Place Division, and the producer-based Precast Division. Global sales, customer service, and technical support are performed by an internal sales team, product support staff, and outside sales force consisting of manufactures'​ representatives.
 
In the Early 1950's, Electrovert, a New York based plastics company developed Durajoint® the ""Original PVC Waterstop"". The original conception of Durajoint® PVC Waterstop was developed and used in a project for the St. Lawrence Seaway, which was once considered an impassable river. With the project completion in 1959 it consisted of 19 locks and 6 canals. Ranked as one of the most outstanding feats of engineering in the twentieth century, this gateway to North America has allowed 2.5 billion tons of cargo over the last 50 years to travel between the Atlantic Ocean and Great Lakes region.

In the mid 1960's, W.R. Grace purchased the Electrovert Company and began marketing the Durajoint® brand under their construction products division, later known as A.C. Horn. In 1993, Tamms Industries purchased A.C. Horn from W.R. Grace, and folded the Durajoint® brand under Tamms. In March of 2001 Michael E. Diskin a former executive of Master Builders Technologies (later known as BASF) purchased the Durajoint® PVC Waterstop line from Tamms and marketed it under the company banner of Durajoint® Concrete Accessories.

In December of 2004, the opportunity to expand the concrete accessories line arose with the acquisition of the Master Builders Preco Concrete Accessories line.",1950,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/6919a1792a94220001acb786/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This innovative technology has been recognized as one of TIME Magazine’s ""Best Inventions of 2020.""

The core product, the WaveCel liner, is integrated into helmets for cycling and snow sports, with plans to expand into other safety applications. The liner functions through three mechanisms: flexing to divert impact forces, crumpling to absorb energy, and gliding to reduce rotational forces, effectively mitigating the risk of concussions. WaveCel's technology has shown to absorb up to 73% more rotational force than standard helmet foam and has received a five-star safety rating from Virginia Tech University’s helmet testing facility.

Welcome! From construction to adventure to everyday life, Titan Straps has offered a simpler, safer and more secure strapping solution since 2010. Highly durable and utilitarian, our tension straps serve multiple purposes. Lash your ladder or steel pipes to your truck rack. Secure gear to your motorcycle or bicycle for off-road adventures. Or bind your skis together for backcountry trips. Use them with one hand, in freezing temps or with gloves on. The possibilities are infinite! 

The first wide, stronger polyurethane tension strap on the market made in a variety of colors, we took the traditional ski strap to the next level. It wasn't until years later that other companies followed suit with varied colors and industrial-strength straps.

Bungees stretch out and break. And face it, ratchet straps serve a purpose, but are heavy, get stuck and are difficult to use when wet and frozen. Titan Straps couldn't be easier to use. And on this Facebook page we'll show you the hundreds of ways you can simplify your life with Titan Straps. Have questions or comments? Please message us or post in the comments section.

The CTAC program involves a continuous improvement cycle, and the outcome evaluates field concrete testing technicians on an individual basis to determine appropriate actions for training, resolutions, and to increase consistency with ASTM Standards.

Currently, many times it is not consistent with ASTM Standards, which ultimately falls back on the concrete producer. For any producers, contractors, municipality, or testing firm and their employees, the CTAC program can be viewed both positively and negatively. The purpose is to develop more consistency to meet ASTM Standards in concrete testing. In using the CTAC program, both Quality Control and Assurance entities can evaluate their own employees and company in comparison with the industry average. Through this information training, consistency, and the industry can be improved and reach the same goal of a completed and successful project(s).",2020,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/68f6a1f33b2bc80001428374/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our products are designed for use by specialty contractors (and mro facility engineers) for structural concrete bonding, patching, crack repair, floor joint filler, spall repair, protective coating and surface restoration. We offer solutions for extreme environments including underwater, corrosive, abrasive and extreme temperatures. All of our products feature 0 or near 0 VOCs and can provide LEED credits. We manufacture 2-component liquid and paste metering pumps for epoxy crack injection, repair of shrinkage cracks, slab delamination, voids, placement of steel and FRP anchors and dowels for seismic retrofit or strength upgrades. 

We also manufacture Epoxy Asphalt, an extremely durable pavement, which is used on long span steel decked bridges. Epoxy Asphalt bridge deck pavements have exhibited proven durability as long as 49 years. Epoxy Asphalt has been found to increase the lifespan of open graded permeable pavements (pavement type also called OGFC). Epoxy Asphalt does not melt, has extremely high fatigue resistance, forms chemical bonds to aggregates and does not oxidize or embrittle. In dense graded pavements, Epoxy Asphalt is impermeable to oxygen, water and salts, forming a protective barrier against corrosive elements.

We make InsulPOX, a three component epoxy insulating polymer concrete (IPC) for use in lining concrete trenches and tunnels of LNG import and export terminals. InsulPOX reduces the concentration of LNG vapors in the local air due to an cryogenic liquid accidental spill and protects concrete and steel from embrittlement  and spalling.

We have staff who proficient in Spanish, German, Cantonese and Chinese languages. We are headquarted near San Francisco, CA and have China offices in Tianjin and Nanjing.",1993,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/684551ab49b7070001e9f716/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 30 years later, we continue that same goal - to control dust, slurry, and hazardous materials such as silica, asbestos, lead, and more.  Our line includes contractor and industrial level vacuums and dust shrouds to fit various tools for that purpose - to capture fine dust.

We perform internal research and design to keep up-to-date on the industry.  We seek to connect with people who can teach us - and our customers - insider tips on tools, home improvement, and construction.

We currently have an extensive dealer network across the United States and Canada, and work with customers in other countries.  While we have an online presence, our primary goal is to partner with brick and mortar dealers and send our customers to their stores.

The HIDE system incorporates your selected surface material into the lid, enabling the HIDE Lid to blend into the surrounding landscape, creating a superior, seamless finish.

HIDE's innovative lids for skimmer boxes, access points and drain covers provide a robust and safe solution to other traditional, less aesthetic covers. They protect your stone and your family for years to come.

A brief overview

Skimmer Lids

A HIDE Skimmer Lid Kit solves the problem of using more traditional covers that stand out on your poolside's coping. Used to replace the round yellow plastic skimmer covers, they allow your poolside to look its very best. Providing more than just aesthetics, HIDE Lids are a safe alternative, opening only with the safety key. They keep the powerful pool pump away from the reach of children. 

 Some benefits of the HIDE Skimmer Lid kit are:

• Matches the surrounding landscape
• Your choice to match grout lines and material through the lid
• Pool safe compliant
• Eliminates stone/tile chipping & cracking
• Sold as a complete kit
• Replaces a traditional plastic lid

Access Covers

HIDE Access Covers are the perfect choice when concealing service points in outdoor areas, as they blend seamlessly into your selected surface. 
HIDE Access Covers are available in a wide range of sizes and depths.
Access covers conceal entry to all service points:
• IO & Bolted trap screw (BTS) 
• Water table pipe 
• Water and balance tanks 
• Taps and irrigation 
• Valves and meters 
• Electrical junction box

Drain Covers

Seamlessly conceal the drain access by doing away with standard metal or plastic grates. These covers are suited to capture surface water.",2014,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/69246b820437ac000142fd70/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our founder noticed something very simple that most people tended to overlook or simply accepted as the norm. What was this simple thing? The almost inescapable loss of suction that occurred with most vacuums used in the construction industry. This of course was caused by the filter becoming clogged with fine dust and debris and cutting off the airflow to the vacuum motor. That's when David set to work. Tinkering in his barn he came up with a lot of different solutions, some better than others. It wasn't until a simple mistake happened one day that everything came together. When testing a design, David forgot to hook up a couple of electrical leads. So a component he had previously thought to be critical simply didn't turn on, but what happened amazed him. The force of the physics at work ""pulsed"" the dust off the filter, better than anything else he'd tried and in that moment Pulse-Bac Technology was born.

Today Pulse-Bac is a readily available brand that offers innovative, high-quality products with 15 patents awarded to us by the US Patent and Trademark offices for the innovations found in our vacuums. The spirit of innovation instilled by our founder is alive and growing every day at Pulse-Bac. Our engineers and production teams are always working to find the next feature that will make our products better for our customers. We are dedicated to helping professionals in many different industries find the best dust collection and vacuum assisted clean up solutions that will increase their productivity and protect their health.

We are also very proud that all of our products are produced in our Tulsa, Oklahoma factory, not far from where it all  begin.

L. Moore and his brother-in-law, Robert Lockridge, founded Oklahoma Steel & Wire, located in Madill, Oklahoma, with the sole purpose of manufacturing livestock panels. The company experienced steady expansion and soon included a comprehensive product line for agricultural and industrial markets.

Market demand created the need for a rod source to ensure a sufficient, reliable supply of steel rods to meet their expanding market. In 2004, Mid-American Steel & Wire, in Madill, Oklahoma, was established, employing 238 additional employees. In 2011, to keep pace in an ever-changing steel market, construction of the Melt Shop Division was completed and production started. Mid American Steel keeps Oklahoma Steel and Iowa Steel supplied with wire rods and allows them to stay competitive in the marketplace.

Although Bob Lockridge lost his battle with cancer in 1982, Max Moore lost his life in a mid-air collision in 2000, and in early 2011 with the passing of B.L. Moore, the family continues to own and direct the daily operations of the companies.

When your projects are protected, the costs associated with delays and shutdowns are minimised. With rapidly inflatable reinforced PVC ‘air beams', a Fast Tent unit is self supporting, no framework or scaffolding is required and it can be quickly & easily relocated. The double walled construction provides very good insulation and robust load bearing capability.

Unlike metal pole systems, which can be heavy, complicated to put together and prone to having parts go missing, an air beam system from Fast Tent only requires a pump to inflate the rigid support structure in a matter of minutes, which means your teams can get on with their work as soon as possible.

Key benefits:

Faster Installation – Whilst a traditional scaffold frame and sheeting such as shrink wrap could take days to achieve, a Fast Tent system inflates in just a couple of minutes.

Consistent Quality – The effectiveness of most traditional tenting and sheeting systems is dependent on the skill of the installer and weather conditions during set up. Fast tent is manufactured and tested off site and we can incorporate colours and corporate branding.

Safe & Sustainable – As fast tent is self supporting, no scaffolding or other framework is required and work at height is eliminated. The system's inflatable skin provides superb insulation and far easier control of the internal environment. Because Fast tent is re-usable there is no sheeting to be disposed of.",2014,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/675d57e2e765f900012bc20c/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Helical piles provide a means of evaluating the soil strength at the tip of elevation. They can be drilled to required depths by means of bolted couplings and require no additional support operations such as ready mix trucks, hole casings, or soil removal. In response to this need, Cantsink developed a pile and brackets specifically tailored to the loads encountered in residential new construction and underpinning. Cantsink offers the industry's only structural helix with radial ribs stamped into the helix. This creates more strength and rigidity and has a patent pending.

Using Cantsink helical piles for new construction gives builders a stable foundation, eliminating the need for time consuming sub walls or augured piles.",1988,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/6923f509f18932000160e6fd/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our first product on the market was our Inspection App and we've since added several new products to include: Toolbox Talk App, JSA App, Observation App, Incident App, Scan App, and PrecipAlert.

Our philosophy is to build ‘simple' apps in order to minimize the learning curve and maximize usage.  We know that if the app is too difficult or complex to use, implementation and buy-in at the user level will be lacking and you'll never fully achieve the benefits of a mobile solution.  Keeping our app interface simple helps our customers overcome this implementation challenge.

While our apps are simple to use, the data is comprehensive and meaningful.  Our customers use this data to help drive safety improvement.  We take great pride in knowing that the data collected using our applications help make workplaces safer and more compliant!

Above all else, we work on providing reliable and timely service and support and if you read our reviews online, you'll see that we constantly succeed in this important area.  We take great pride in the service we provide and the relationships we build with our subscribers.

Industrial Concrete Incorporated (ICI) started business in 1996 in Fredericksburg, Virginia. In it's first year, ICI employed approximately twenty people and worked mainly on small, commercial, turn-key concrete projects in the general area located between Richmond, VA and Washington DC.

2001 PLACE & FINISH DIVISION
ICI started a ""Place and Finish"" division in 2001. This division specializes in large commercial, industrial and governmental mass concrete placement. The average pour size is normally between 10,000 sf and 15,000 sf, but the ICI place and finish crews have also poured 40,000 to 50,000 sf in one day with multiple crews.

2009 MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
ICI added an in-house engineer/estimator, a project development director and purchased technically advanced estimating software packages. These changes to the ICI management structure are already helping to improve their relationships and bidding procedures with all customers. ICI now has the capabilities to produce large scale, accurate, and mass concrete estimates.

CURRENT STATISTICS
On a yearly average, ICI employs over 100 employees, works in the Mid-Atlantic area, places over 50,000 cubic yards and finishes over 1,000,000 sf of concrete.

GROWTH AND THE FUTURE
The company's growth has been the result of the expanding customer base that has continued to expand over the years, mainly due to ICI's job performance history. In the future, ICI strives to take the company to the next level. ICI is devoted to continue to improve its job performance reputation that has been built over the years.",1996,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/691ef7874e768e000113b39f/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
