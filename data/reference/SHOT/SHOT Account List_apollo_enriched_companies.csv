The SAW-Mag 150 round magazine for the AR15 pattern .223/5.56mm rifle and all weapons accepting AR-15 / AR15 / M16 magazines using the STANAG 4179 standard.

Designed to fit NATO standard (STANAG-4179) rifles, the SAW-MAG™ quickly converts a rifleman with a standard M4 into automatic support personnel. The flexibility of such force multiplication makes the SAW-MAG™ the most dominant accessory for the M4/M16/M27/HK416 family of weapons.

The SAW-MAG™ is a hybrid design externally constructed of thick walled long glass polymer and steel. This allows the magazine to have the durability to survive real world conditions. The hardened steel USGI tower allows it to fit into any weapon that accepts the 30 round standard magazine. All parts are from production tooling for precision and economics.

The SAW-MAG™ was designed to have the lowest operating drag due to friction. The ammunition is contained individually inside the drums on sprockets, each cartridge gets its own separate space, the ammunition is picked off the sprockets when they spin, not a typical high friction convergence found on cheaper designs. This is why our system does not require graphite lubrication to work. Instead of funneling the ammunition, the SAW-MAG™ uses a proprietary design that allows the ammunition to always be in a singular stream which results in a very low friction operation.

Mesa Tactical® was formed in 2003 to design and produce high quality tactical accessories for shotguns. The company's first products were cast aluminum telescoping stock adapters for Remington and Mossberg shotguns that allowed the installation of AR-15 stocks and grips on these platforms. 

From the beginning, Mesa Tactical's overriding design philosophy was to produce the most functional and robust accessories possible, even if it meant they would cost more. The company's primary focus was on law enforcement markets.

In early 2005, Mesa Tactical introduced its all-aluminum SureShell® on-gun shotshell carriers. Within a few years, the SureShell line became a favorite of law enforcement armorers across the country, who appreciated its thoughtful design and material toughness. By the beginning of 2013, Mesa Tactical had shipped over 50,000 SureShell shell carriers.

Another departure was in late 2010, when Mesa Tactical began shipping its first injection molded part, the Urbino® tactical stock for the Benelli M4. Urbino stocks have since been introduced for a variety of Remington and Benelli platforms. 

Mesa Tactical's largest customers include both the Los Angeles Police Department and Sheriff's Office; Orange County Sheriff's Departments in both California and Florida; FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Looking forward, Mesa Tactical will continue to develop innovative, robust accessories for tactical shotguns, and will soon introduce products for carbines and other rifle platforms.

Mesa Tactical's products include stocks, forends, shotshell carriers, scope mounts and Picatinny rails.

But in the early spring of 2018, we zoomed out and began to realize that the Index brand simply didn't ladder up to our core values. While they served us well for decades, our customers expect us to stay ahead of the curling wave of industry trends, and we needed an updated, modern brand and website to communicate just that.
  From the aerospace to medical device industries and even all the way down to the textile industry, we've impacted supply chains. At the end of the day, though, we share one major attribute with our customers: We are the working class. Our histories and legacies are deeply woven together into a blue collar narrative. Even though our customers span an incredibly wide range of industries, we're proud to have fostered personal relationships with many of them—a significant number of them have been steadily built for 40 years. We use these relationships as our guiding light at every turn in our decision making process from the top down, and so it was only natural that it took a front seat during the brand refresh conversation and is now fully reflected in our name.
  This brand strategy serves as a 10k' view of what we do. Simple, straightforward, no minced words is both who we are and what we do.

(EMF) was founded to supply the demand for the guns seen in the movies and on television. At the time Colt had stopped production of single action revolvers and declined to resume production. EMF became a major distributor, and then manufacturer, of the Great Western , the first reproduction of the famous Colt Model 1873 SAA. When the strong dollar made it too costly to produce the model 1873 in the U.S., EMF turned to Europe as the European gun manufacturers began the replica firearms industry there. During the past 53 years. EMF has traveled the world to bring ""The Best In Cowboy Guns"" to first, American Cowboys, and then Cowboy Action Shooters. EMF's efforts have culminated in the introduction of the Great Western II, which is an authentic copy of the original 1873 Colt.

Our Mission: EMF's mission is to provide quality, authentic, but safe, firearms at the best prices. The keystone of EMF's ""Cowboy Way"" is to provide friendly, personal customer service and stand behind our products. The amazing growth of the sport of Cowboy Action Shooting has fueled the demand for the guns of the Old West. Boyd A. Davis, CEO/President of EMF is also known as General U.S. Grant. SASS #2.

We work to invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints. As an anti-censorship organization, we expose neglected news stories and defend working journalists when they are muzzled. As a progressive group, FAIR believes that structural reform is ultimately needed to break up the dominant media conglomerates, establish independent public broadcasting and promote strong non-profit sources of information.

Uniquely, FAIR works with both activists and journalists. We maintain a regular dialogue with reporters at news outlets across the country, providing constructive critiques when called for and applauding exceptional, hard-hitting journalism. We also encourage the public to contact media with their concerns, to become media activists rather than passive consumers of news.

FAIR publishes Extra!, the newsletter of media criticism, and produces the weekly radio program CounterSpin, the show that brings you the news behind the headlines. In addition, FAIR's thriving email list distributes articles and Action Alerts to our international network of over 50,000 activists. Sign up today!

For an in-depth explanation of FAIR's critique of the mainstream media, you should start with our overview, What's Wrong with the News? You might also check out the article What's FAIR?, by FAIR founder Jeff Cohen. See what journalists, activists and scholars have to say about FAIR.

• Our hunting bullets are cast from LBT style molds.
• Our bullets are cast from virgin alloy and heat-treated to a Brinnel hardness of 18-21. This provides for a hard yet ductile bullet, which will not fragment, or blow-up on the toughest hide or even bone.
• We manufacture both gas checked and plain base for most popular handgun hunting calibers.
• Our bullets do not lead your bore. Our lube has allowed us to shoot our cast bullets in test rifles as fast as 3100 fps.

We saw brands shift away from marketing in-person to virtual ""social"" spaces hyping the ability to connect and transact. Over the years we have all learned that these virtual connections are exactly as defined; almost or nearly a connection, but not as complete. The global pandemic especially highlighted humanity's need to connect face-to-face, and a surge in events as we recovered reaffirms that nothing substitutes for those meaningful connections in-person.

Strike seeks to streamline the grind for the Road Warriors that are out there staging event after event—passionately growing their brand through miles on the road, inclement weather, shoe string budgets, and emotional roller coasters. By refining details, improving materials, and providing unparalleled ease there will be no distractions from the meaningful connections you're trying to create with your customers, followers, athletes, partners, and fans.

Strike is more than the sum or parts of our products or services, it is style defined by substance: A unwavering reliability that you can trust from concept to design, from engineering to delivery, and from setup to take down. 

When beautifully curated events are easier to create, there's more time and energy to really connect and be remembered... Your audience is waiting.",2012,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/68247116cbd1ee0001f06f3c/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This year marks 15 years of innovation and precision at Victor Company, and I couldn't be more excited to share what's ahead. From the very beginning, our mission has been to engineer rock-solid products that give shooters the edge they need to perform at their best—and that commitment is stronger than ever.

In 2022, I stepped into my new role as President and Sole Owner/Founder, taking Victor Company into its next chapter. Along with that, I made a big move — relocating from La Cañada, CA, to Wyoming, a place that reflects the spirit of hard work and resilience that defines our brand.

This year, we're bringing game-changing new products to the lineup, including the TRS Arca Rail & Brass Weights, HR15 AR-15 Handguard with a built-in Arca, RPG Chassis System with your choice of COMP FOREND or HR1 Handguard, and the TITAN22 LT HUNTER Stock. Each is designed with the same no-compromise durability and performance you expect from us.

Thank you for being part of this journey. Whether you've been with us since the start or are just discovering Victor Company, I'm proud to have you on board. Here's to 15 years—and to the next chapter of precision, innovation and excellence!

Vector Optics has provided premium optics and innovative sighting systems for more than 15 years. 
We design, build and test our scopes & red dot sights for rifles and pistols to be used in all fields of applications for hunting, defense, sporting & competition.

BRAND EVOLUTION
The company originated under the name Sunclear but as time progressed Stephen wanted to change the name to something more product specific. Vector is defined as a quantity having direction as well as magnitude, especially as determining the position of one point in space relative to another. He was dwelling on this thought when an American partner suggested the name ""Vector Optics"". Stephen decided that name sounded more appropriate and thought it would be more widely recognized and remembered by optics consumers. Since that time Sunclear, was officially changed to the Vector Optics® and is still in use today.

Early in our history, we developed some of the first contactless access control door lock systems used in hotels and commercial buildings.  Always striving to improve our products, we integrated biometric fingerprint authentication into these lock systems. 

Adjacent security industries soon came to recognize the technological acumen of SECURAM and began requesting our development of security systems for other markets.  

The high security safe lock market had been struggling to deliver innovative technological solutions, so after numerous requests from this market, we began our development of a complete line of electronic locks for safes. Now 12 years later, we have introduced over 150 different high security safe lock products. These safe lock solutions are used all over the world in banks, ATMs, cash safes, personal and gun safes. Everywhere highly valuable items are stored, SECURAM  products are sure to be found. 

As the smart home movement started with the introduction of various IOT devices for the home, safe owners began looking for ways to connect their safes also. SECURAM  took on the challenge and developed a series of connected safe lock systems that could be managed and controlled from a smartphone app. 

As our expertise with smart technologies expanded, we came to recognize the necessity of improved security of the devices offered in the smart home segment. Thus, our team of talented engineers set out to integrate the high security protocols developed for the safe lock market into secure devices for smart homes. Today, we have a broad array of highly secure smart devices for the connected home. From biometric smart locks for your front door, to perimeter security sensors, and smart garage door controllers, SECURAM  ​can be trusted to keep guard over your family and home.

Our Mantra:
To foster a culture where commitment to excellence in product innovation, quality and customer service permeates all we do. To deliver the best products to enable all outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy the highest level of comfort and performance in any cold weather activity.  The R&D process never ends for us and we continue to search out and use the very best materials and workmanship.

How it all started:
Seirus grew out of 2 guys intent on creating solutions to issues that limited the winter experience of the outdoor enthusiast. One looking to help preserve the boot/binding compatibility for more predictable release while skiing. Thus Cat Tracks were born, which also make for a more comfortable & secure walking experience on winter surfaces. And the other wanting to shield his chops during frequent forays into that sweet Utah powder. Viola, the Original Masque was born. While neither of these young outdoor entrepreneurs ever imagined one day these pocket sized, self-fashioned gems would actually put food on the table, they were ambitious & eager to take their new inventions to the market. 

Flash forward 3 decades and families of products are thriving and engineered to keep you warm like no one else. Now over 300 cold weather protection items and a burgeoning crop of sun protection products are the fruit of the combined imaginations of Seirus'​ development team, striving to bring both comfort and protection to al of us who love the snowy outdoors. Seirus has been the industry's major innovator & first to market for products to protect the head, hands & feet.",1984,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/69318acb0d48da00016d1937/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOB™ Defense Systems provide the highest level of protection possible while allowing for mobility, agility, and overall versatility in a variety of circumstances.

SOB™ Defense Systems fill the gap between body armor and armored vehicles. Situations often arise where operators need the confidence and security of head-to-toe ballistic coverage; body armor can't provide that. Armored vehicles provide excellent coverage, but they cannot be taken through doorways, down hallways, or into elevators.

Hunting is in each member of our team's DNA, and as such we understand the rigours of our passion wherever they may take us around the world, and bind all of our knowledge and efforts together to ensure our designs never fall short of any requirement for that product's application.

Our flagship product – the Javelin Bipod – is a testament to our dedication to providing quality, practical solutions for all rifle shooting disciplines. Like many of our products since, it was invented with a desire to create a new-age adaptation of a traditional solution that could simply attach and detach as and when needed, that wasn't cumbersome to carry and as practical in the pursuit of tahr and ibex as it is reds and roe deer. 

""For shooters wanting to push the boundaries, gear available on the market just didn't cut it,"" admits founder Rob (Mr G) Gearing. ""In my younger years as a guide, I rapidly fell out of love with having a bipod hanging from my rifle and I used one infrequently. They got in the way and were a pain in my shoulder when carrying my rifle, and my eventual reluctance to carry a one presented me with a few failed hunts. 

""So, applying my background in aviation engines and, in particular, discovery of rare earth magnets when working on the Concord aircraft sculpture, the resulting invention was an ultra-lightweight, stupidly strong bipod that could be on and off the rifle quicker than you could drop the legs on a run-of-the-mill bipod. Exactly what I was after.""

As such, the Javelin Bipod was an instant success among rifle shooters all around the world and formed a foundation from which all Spartan products – from entry level to top-end – are forged. Now, over half a decade into production, our fleet of rifle and optic support systems have generated a loyal and growing following that we are ever grateful for.",2012,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/6919eb5d24c55e0001fb7f6e/picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Developed in 1926 by Harvey Williams in Davison, Michigan.  Harvey realized nearly a century ago firearms had inadequate sights and there was a need by customers for quality after-market sights.  Harvey developed his sights over the decades until they became the industry standard for customers looking to improve their accuracy.

It wasn't until the 1950's Williams branched out providing local customers with gunsmithing and retail services.  Through the years Williams retail became well known locally as the ""go to"" firearm store because of their superior product knowledge, gunsmithing, and public ranges. In recent years Williams retail store has now grown to 25,000 sq feet including indoor and outdoor ranges while maintaining their experienced gunsmithing department.

Williams Gun Sight has continued to succeed because of this perfect combination between our manufacturing and retail division.  Having a retail store allows our manufacturing division to thrive with product development for our gun sight customers.

In 1960, the company—then known as Aeroprojects—invented ultrasonic metal welding and received the first patent ever awarded for this technology:  our exclusive Wedge-Reed System.  During the intervening years, Sonobond has earned an outstanding reputation for its pioneering work and quality engineered products.  Today we manufacture a complete line of bonding and welding equipment for companies in the metals, plastics, and nonwovens/textiles industries.  These include units for applications in aerospace, apparel, appliance, automotive, battery, body armor, electrical, electronic, environmental, filtration, HVAC, photovoltaic, and medical fields.    

Ultrasonic Welding Technology is Environmentally Friendly

Ultrasonic bonding is fast, accurate, economical, and safe for the environment.  

No adhesives, solder, thread, or other consumables are used.  Instead, the process features a specially-designed head that channels high-frequency vibrations to create a rapid, localized buildup of heat in non-ferrous metals, rigid plastics, or synthetic fabrics.  The resulting heat is then used to weld, bond, cut, or slit these materials without heating the surrounding area.  The process is energy-efficient, ultra-reliable and produces strong, high-quality results.  

Sonobond Ultrasonics equipment is available in both stand-alone and modular form.  The modular units are designed for convenient integration into a production line or custom machinery.  All models are easy to operate and require only minimal training.",1960,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/6932fafdf9b20800016a06a5/picture,INDUCTOTHERM GROUP INDIA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a woman majority owned company, Tiger Enterprises & Trading, Inc. started operations in Ellington, CT in 1993, under the direction of Mrs. Bonnie Walker, the current Chief Financial Officer and majority owner. Subsequent growth and expansion over the years led Tiger to seek larger operating facilities in Tolland, CT. Tiger later moved operations two more times to other separate and larger facilities in and around Ellington, CT.

Tiger's continued growth necessitated the need to add industry experienced personnel. This was accomplished in 1995 with the addition of Mr. Dwight Walker, Bonnie's husband, who brought over 18 years of industry experience from Hamilton Standard. Mr. Walker is now Chief Executive Officer of Tiger Enterprises.

ZRO means ‘zero' and Delta means ‘shift, change, or difference', or ‘no difference' for short. I.E. A user could remove a zeroed optic and mount from a firearm, replace it at a later time, and experience no shift or change in the point of impact of the weapon system. The company's name was born: ZRODelta.

The company has expanded far beyond mounts, designing and manufacturing industry-leading weapons, parts, and accessories that define innovation. When we say ZRODelta: The Delta is ZRO, we mean that the difference is ZRO. We are the change within the industry, offering the most modular handgun platform available today, the only semi-automatic precision rifle with a 1/2MOA guarantee, world-class OEM parts production solutions, and best-in-category mounting solutions.

Peltonen Knives' products have been developed with functionality in mind - as tools for professionals and as a trusted companion for the quality-conscious hunters and for all adventurers. 

A good knife should be safe to use, fitting the hand nicely with a firm grip. The blade should bite efficiently into the material being worked on. The finishing touch of a perfect knife is, of course, a proper sheath — one that can securely hold the knife in place while still providing the user with an easy way to pull it out when needed.

Our knives have been made with care and its materials have been chosen with precision, considering the needs of the widest possible user base.
All of our knives are crafted with care and precision, picking out materials that suit a wide range of users.  Our knives are robust tools fitting the needs of military, bushcrafters, hunters, survivalists or - for all out there exploring the wild.
